Smart Farming

To tackle the increasing challenges of agricultural production, the complex agricultural ecosystems need to be
better understood. This can happen by means of modern digital technologies that monitor continuously the
physical environment, producing large quantities of data in an unprecedented pace. The analysis of this (big)
data would enable farmers and companies to extract value from it, improving their productivity. Although big
data analysis is leading to advances in various industries, it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The
objective of this paper is to perform a review on current studies and research works in agriculture which employ
the recent practice of big data analysis, in order to solve various relevant problems. Thirty-four diﬀerent studies
are presented, examining the problem they address, the proposed solution, tools, algorithms and data used,
nature and dimensions of big data employed, scale of use as well as overall impact. Concluding, our review
highlights the large opportunities of big data analysis in agriculture towards smarter farming, showing that the
availability of hardware and software, techniques and methods for big data analysis, as well as the increasing
openness of big data sources, shall encourage more academic research, public sector initiatives and business
ventures in the agricultural sector. This practice is still at an early development stage and many barriers need to
be overcome.

1. Introduction
Population growth, along with socioeconomic factors have historically been associated to food shortage (Slavin, 2016). In the last
50 years, the world’s population has grown from three billion to more
than six, creating a high demand for food (Kitzes et al., 2008). As the
(Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2009) estimates, the global population would increase by more than 30% until
2050, which means that a 70% increase on food production must be
achieved. Land degradation and water contamination, climate change,
sociocultural development (e.g. dietary preference of meat protein),
governmental policies and market ﬂuctuations add uncertainties to
food security (Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010), deﬁned as access to
suﬃcient, safe and nutritious food by all people on the planet. These
uncertainties challenge agriculture to improve productivity, lowering at
the same time its environmental footprint, which currently accounts for
the 20% of the anthropogenic Greenhouses Gas (GHG) emissions (Sayer
and Cassman, 2013).
To satisfy these increasing demands, several studies and initiatives
have been launched since the 1990s. Advancements in crop growth
modeling and yield monitoring (Basso et al., 2001), together with
global navigation satellite systems (e.g. GPS) (Aqeel ur et al., 2014)
have enabled precise localization of point measurements in the ﬁeld, so

⁎

that spatial variability maps can be created (Pierce and N., 1999), a
concept known as “precision agriculture” (Bell et al., 1995).
Nowadays, agricultural practices are being supported by biotechnology (Rahman et al., 2013) and emerging digital technologies
such as remote sensing (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000), cloud computing
(Hashem et al., 2015) and Internet of Things (IoT) (Weber and Weber,
2010), leading to the notion of “smart farming” (Tyagi, 2016; Babinet
Gilles et al., 2015). The deployment of new information and communication technologies (ICT) for ﬁeld-level crop/farm management extend the precision agriculture concept (Lokers et al., 2016), enhancing
the existing tasks of management and decision making by context
(Kamilaris et al., 2016), situation and location awareness (Karmas et al.,
2016).
Smart farming is important for tackling the challenges of agricultural production in terms of productivity, environmental impact,
food security and sustainability. Sustainable agriculture (Senanayake,
1991) is very relevant and directly linked to smart farming
(Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2004), as it enhances the environmental quality and resource base in which agriculture depends,
providing basic human food needs (Pretty, 2008). It can be understood
as an ecosystem-based approach to agriculture, which integrates biological, chemical, physical, ecological, economic and social sciences in
a comprehensive way, in order to develop safe smart farming practices

that do not degrade our environment.
To address the challenges of smart farming and sustainable agriculture, as (McQueen et al., 1995) and (Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010)
point out, the complex, multivariate and unpredictable agricultural
ecosystems need to be better analyzed and understood. The aforementioned emerging digital technologies contribute to this understanding by monitoring and measuring continuously various aspects of
the physical environment (Sonka, 2016), producing large quantities of
data in an unprecedented pace (Chi et al., 2016). This implies, as
(Hashem et al., 2015) note, the need for large-scale collection, storage,
pre-processing, modeling and analysis of huge amounts of data coming
from various heterogeneous sources.
Agricultural “big data” creates the necessity for large investments in
infrastructures for data storage and processing (Nandyala and Kim,
2016; Hashem et al., 2015), which need to operate almost in real-time
for some applications (e.g. weather forecasting, monitoring for crops’
pests and animals’ diseases). Hence, “big data analysis” is the term used
to describe a new generation of practices (Kempenaar et al., 2016;
Sonka, 2016), designed so that farmers and related organizations can
extract economic value from very large volumes of a wide variety of
data by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery, and/or analysis
(Waga and Rabah, 2014; Lokers et al., 2016).
Big data analysis is successfully being used in various industries,
such as banking, insurance, online user behavior understanding and
personalization, as well as in environmental studies (Waga and Rabah,
2014; Cooper et al., 2013). As (Kim et al., 2014) show, governmental
organizations use big data analysis to enhance their ability to serve
their citizens addressing national challenges related to economy, health
care, job creation, natural disasters and terrorism.
Although big data analysis seems to be successful and popular in
many domains, it started being applied to agriculture only recently
(Lokers et al., 2016), when stakeholders started to perceive its potential
beneﬁts (Bunge, 2014; Sonka, 2016). According to some of the largest
agricultural corporations, tailoring advice to farmers based on analyzing big data could increase annual global proﬁts from crops by about
US $20 billion (Bunge, 2014).
The motivation for preparing this survey stems from the fact that big
data analysis in agriculture is a modern technique with growing popularity, while recent advancements and applications of big data in
other domains indicate its large potential (Kim et al., 2014; Cooper
et al., 2013). Current relevant surveys (Wolfert et al., 2017; Nandyala
and Kim, 2016; Waga and Rabah, 2014; Wu et al., 2016) cover mostly
theoretical aspects of this technique (e.g. conceptual framework, socioeconomics, business processes, stakeholders’ network) or focus on
particular sub-domains such as remote sensing (Chi et al., 2016; Liaghat
and Balasundram, 2010; Teke et al., 2013; Ozdogan et al., 2010;
Karmas et al., 2014) and geospatial analysis (Karmas et al., 2016).
Thus, the main contribution of this survey is that it presents a more
focused overview of the particular problems encountered in agriculture,
compared to existing surveys, where data analysis is a key aspect and
solutions are found inside the big data realm. Our survey highlights the
(big) data used, the methods and techniques employed, giving speciﬁc
insights from a technical perspective on the potential and opportunities
of big data analysis, open issues, barriers and ways to overcome them.

“Big Data” AND [“Precision Agriculture” OR “Smart Farming” OR
“Agriculture“]
In this way, we ﬁltered out papers referring to big data but not
applied to the agricultural domain. Existing surveys (Wolfert et al.,
2017; Nandyala and Kim, 2016; Waga and Rabah, 2014; (Chi et al.,
2016; Wu et al., 2016) were also examined for related work. From this
eﬀort, 1330 papers were initially identiﬁed. Restricting the search for
papers in English only, with at least two citations, the initial number of
papers was reduced to 232. Number of citations was recorded based on
Google Scholar. An exception was made for papers published in
2016–2017, where zero citations were acceptable.
In the second step, we checked these 232 papers whether they made
actual use of big data analysis in some agricultural application. Use of big
data analysis was quantiﬁed as satisfying some of its ﬁve “V” characteristics (Chi et al., 2016) (see Section 3). We primarily targeted the
ﬁrst three “V”s (i.e. volume, velocity and variety), since dimensions V4
and V5 (i.e. veracity and valorization) were more diﬃcult to quantify.
From the 232 papers, only 34 qualiﬁed according to our constraints. We
were forced to discard (also) a small number of interesting eﬀorts which
did not qualify in terms of the data analysis employed and the solutions
provided. In the ﬁnal step, the 34 papers selected from the previous step
were analyzed one-by-one, considering the problem they addressed,
solution proposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools, systems and
algorithms used, sources of data employed and which “V” dimensions
of big data they satisﬁed.

3. Big data in agriculture
Chi et al. (2016) characterize big data according to the following
ﬁve dimensions:

• Volume (V1): The size of data collected for analysis.
• Velocity (V2): The time window in which data is useful and re•
•
•

levant. For example, some data should be analyzed in a reasonable
time to achieve a given task, e.g. to identify pests (PEAT UG, 2016)
and animal diseases (Chedad et al., 2001).
Variety (V3): Multi-source (e.g. images, videos, remote and ﬁeldbased sensing data), multi-temporal (e.g. collected on diﬀerent
dates/times), and multi-resolution (e.g. diﬀerent spatial resolution
images) as well as data having diﬀerent formats, from various
sources and disciplines, and from several application domains.
Veracity (V4): The quality, reliability and potential of the data, as
well as its accuracy, reliability and overall conﬁdence.
Valorization (V5): The ability to propagate knowledge, appreciation and innovation.

Although these ﬁve “V”s can describe big data, big data analysis
does not need to satisfy all ﬁve dimensions (Rodriguez et al., 2017). Big
data is generally notorious for being less accurate and stable, usually
compromising V4 (veracity). Another relevant “V” could be visualization, meaning the need of presenting complex data structures and
rich information in an easy-to-understand way (Hashem et al., 2015;
Karmas et al., 2016).
According to the above, as (Wolfert et al., 2017) explain, big data is
less a matter of data volume than the capacity to search, aggregate,
visualize and cross-reference large datasets in reasonable time. It is
about the capability to extract information and insights where previously it was economically or technically not feasible to do so (Sonka,
2016).
In the following subsections, the most relevant research eﬀorts, case
studies and techniques in terms of solving agricultural problems by
using big data analysis are discussed (Section 3.1), together with
sources of big data (Section 3.2) and speciﬁc techniques employed for
big data analysis (Section 3.3).

2. Methodology
The bibliographic analysis in the domain under study involved three
steps: (a) collection of related work, (b) ﬁltering of relevant work, and
(c) detailed review and analysis of state of the art related work. In the
ﬁrst step, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles
was performed from the scientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore and
ScienceDirect, as well as from the web scientiﬁc indexing services Web
of Science (Thomson Reuters, 2017) and Google Scholar. As search
keywords, we used the following query:

mapping, weather forecasting and food security require large volumes
of data. Recognition of animals' diseases and plants' poor nutrition require high velocity, as well as decisions on farmers' productivity,
weather forecasting and safety/quality of food, which need to be taken
in (near) real time. In these cases, the time horizon of the decisions
involved requires operational or tactical planning, instead of longerterm strategic planning (i.e. lower velocity). Some applications such as
insurance indexes and farmers' (sustainable) productivity improvement
require a wide variety of data from heterogeneous sources. Finally,
some applications require high reliability of the data involved, such as
diseases of plants/animals, herd culling, farmers' improvement of productivity and estimations of yield.
In general, big data analysis in smart farming is still at an early
development stage, and this can be inferred from the currently limited
number of scientiﬁc publications and commercial initiatives. This fact is
supported by the ﬁndings listed in Fig. 1, produced by Web of Science
(Thomson Reuters, 2017), based on the search:
“Big Data” AND [“Agriculture” OR “Farm”]

3.1. Applications of big data analysis in agriculture
As described in Section 2, 34 diﬀerent applications of big data
analysis in agriculture were selected for further analysis. This analysis
covered the agricultural area concerned, the particular problem
tackled, the solution and/or impact through the analysis performed,
tools/algorithms used for addressing the problem, sources of data as
well as an estimation (by the authors) of the ﬁrst three “V”s of big data
(i.e. volume, velocity, variety), using only simple indicators such as low
(L), medium (M) or high (H). These estimations were based on the
following: we ﬁrst recorded all big data-related information from the
papers we reviewed and secondly we compared these papers among
them to create relative rankings, labeling each “V” dimension of each
paper as L, M or H. As mentioned previously, dimensions V4 and V5
were not considered, as they are diﬃcult to quantify. Our complete
analysis for each of the 34 papers is provided in Appendix A.
Table 1 presents the general agricultural areas related with the
papers identiﬁed in the survey. The third column of Table 1 shows the
number of papers providing solutions in some area. Most of the studies
deal with food availability and security, farmers’ insurance and ﬁnance,
weather and climate change, land management and animals-based research. From Table 1, columns 4–6 indicate the average rating by the
authors of the ﬁrst three “V”s of big data (volume, velocity and variety),
as used at each agricultural area.
Most of the papers involve medium-to-high volumes of data, with
medium-to-low velocity and variety. Exceptions are the animals- and
weeds-related projects, which employ high velocity (considering that
evidence of weeds and diseases require urgent actions). Also, exceptions
are the weather and climate change-related eﬀorts, biodiversity-based
and farmers’ decision making apps, which are characterized by a high
variety of information (considering the need for various diﬀerent data
sources to forecast weather, model climate change, estimate biodiversity or eﬀectively assist farmers’ everyday tasks).
The highest volume of data appears in remote sensing applications,
due to the large size of the images. The lowest velocity occurs in landrelated projects, papers on food availability and security, biodiversity
and soil analysis. Finally, the lowest variety appears in weeds-, soil-,
crops- and animals-related research, and in remote sensing. This indicates that these areas do not require (or do not have access to) a
variety of data, in order to address their particular problems.
While Table 1 listed the “V” dimensions in general agricultural research areas, Table 2 depicts which “V” characteristics are highly used
in the particular agricultural applications of the papers under study.
Applications related to estimations of crop production and yields, land

returning 110 papers (only a fraction of which were actually relevant) and 140 citations in the last 4 years. In contrast to the rather
profuse bibliography on big data, its subset on agriculture appears to be
relatively recent and limited. When compared to the other research
areas employing big data analysis, “agriculture” ranks at the 56th position in published papers. However, the ﬁndings indicate a rising
trend.
3.2. Sources of big data
Considering the analysis performed, it is worth examining the
sources of big data used by the diﬀerent papers under study, which
originate from various diﬀerent sources, such as the farmers’ ﬁeld, i.e.
from ground sensors (e.g. chemical detection devices, biosensors,
weather stations, etc.) (Chedad et al., 2001; Kempenaar et al., 2016),
(historical) data gathered by governmental and third-party organizations (e.g. statistical yearbooks, governmental reports, regulations1 and
guidelines from public bodies, alerts, etc.), distributed via online repositories and web services (McQueen et al., 1995; Tesfaye et al.,
2016), data from airborne sensors (e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles, airplanes and satellites) (Becker-Reshef et al., 2010; Gutiérrez et al.,
2008), real-time web data from private companies through online web
services (GSMA, 2014; Syngenta, 2010), crowdsourcing-based

techniques from mobile phones (e.g. transportation data, information
about plants, crops, yields, weather conditions, etc.) (Akinboro, 2016;
Global Envision, 2006), feeds from social media (e.g. mentioning of
natural hazards happening, pests/diseases identiﬁed in various farms
and ﬁelds) (Sawant et al., 2016), etc.
The aforementioned sources are mostly heterogeneous and the data
diﬀers in volume and velocity. They are represented in diﬀerent types
and formats, while access to the data varies as well (e.g. web services,
static repositories, live feeds, ﬁles and archives etc.).
Table 3 lists the diﬀerent sensors and data sources (column 3) employed at each agricultural area (column 2). Each agricultural application requires diﬀerent sources of big data to address the problem it
tackles. Almost in all agricultural areas, information from static databases and datasets is being used, while geospatial data and data from
satellite-based remote sensing are quite popular. Crop-, soil- and animal-related research utilize ground sensors deployed at the ﬁeld, while
weather stations are employed in weather and climate change applications, land mapping, farmers' decision making, insurance and ﬁnance.
Except from a few approaches (Tripathi et al., 2006; Chedad et al.,
2001; Meyer et al., 2004; Armstrong et al., 2007; Urtubia et al., 2007;
Jóźwiaka et al., 2016; GSMA, 2014), most of the reviewed papers
combine data from a variety of sources to address their particular

3.3. Techniques and tools for big data analysis
Table 3 also presents the particular techniques and approaches
(column 4) employed in the diﬀerent agricultural areas which are
considered in the papers under review (column 2). All the 34 studies
analyze big data according to some particular technique or combination
of methods, such as those listed in (Vitolo et al., 2015; Mucherino et al.,
2009). As Table 3 shows, machine learning (used in 13 papers), cloudbased platforms (9), image processing (8), modeling and simulation (7),
statistical analysis (6) and NDVI vegetation indices (6) are the most
commonly used techniques, while some approaches employ online
services (e.g. publish/subscribe messaging, online portals, decision
support) (5) and geographical information systems (GIS) (4). Except
from soil applications, the rest employ a combination of techniques,
especially land applications with remote sensing (Barrett et al., 2014;
Wardlow et al., 2007; Becker-Reshef et al., 2010).
Machine learning tools (Ma et al., 2014; Mucherino et al., 2009) are
used in prediction (Tripathi et al., 2006; Kempenaar et al., 2016),
clustering (Pierna et al., 2004) and classiﬁcation problems (Armstrong
et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2004) while image processing (Chi et al.,

became available at no cost (Wulder et al., 2012). Remote sensing has
several advantages when applied to agriculture (Teke et al., 2013),
being a well-known, non-destructive method to collect information
systematically over very large geographical areas. A modern application of remote sensing in agriculture, as observed from the surveyed
papers, is on the delivery of operational insurance products such as
insurance from crop damage (de Leeuw et al., 2014; Global Envision,
2006), ﬂood and ﬁre risk assessment (de Leeuw et al., 2014), or from
drought and excess rain (Syngenta, 2010).
For large areas such as countries, the primary sources of data have
typically been coarse-resolution satellites with wide-area coverage
(Atzberger, 2013), such as AVHRR, MODIS, MERIS and SPOT-VEGETATION. From the surveyed papers, relevant agricultural applications
include weather forecasting (Schnase et al., 2014; Becker-Reshef et al.,
2010) and characterization/mapping of crops (Galford et al., 2008), soil
and land (Barrett et al., 2014; Schuster et al., 2011). On the other hand,
data from high spatial resolution satellites like Landsat and SPOT have
been used in support of local- and regional-scale applications requiring
increased spatial detail (Ozdogan et al., 2010), such as farmers' decision
making support (Sawant et al., 2016). Finally, some papers use airplanes and drones to achieve their goals, focusing on weeds’ identiﬁcation (Gutiérrez et al., 2008), or grassland inventories (Barrett et al.,
2014). Combining remote sensing with ancillary data (e.g. GIS data,
historical data, ﬁeld sensors, etc.) signiﬁcantly improves the analysis
performed, especially when it includes some form of prediction, i.e.
crop identiﬁcation (Waldhoﬀ et al., 2012) or accuracy of distinguishing
grasslands (Barrett et al., 2014).
The relatively low identiﬁcation of related work, mostly produced
in the last 8–10 years, indicates that big data in smart farming is still at
an early development stage, an observation made also by Lokers et al.
(2016) and Bunge (2014), however with increasing adoption, use and
application in various agricultural areas, as discussed by Sonka (2016).
The increasing number of scientiﬁc peer-reviewed publications indicate
the large potential of big data analysis applied in the domain of agriculture. The ﬁeld presents a high degree of dynamics with a diverse
stakeholders’ network and new players entering continuously the
market, mostly in the form of high-tech companies and start-ups, such
as (SenseFly, 2012; aWhere Inc., 2015; PEAT UG, 2016; Blue River
Technology, 2011), taking existing and creating new roles in agricultural big data analysis and management. As Hashem et al. (2015)
and Kempenaar et al. (2016) point out, high-tech companies, together
with large investments in cloud platforms for larger storage and computation capabilities, could create new services and business analytics
at a new scale and speed, inventing new business models.

2016; Manickavasagan et al., 2005) is used when data originates from
images (i.e. cameras (Meyer et al., 2004) and remote sensing (Sakamoto
et al., 2005)). Image processing includes algorithms for Fourier and
harmonic analysis, wavelet decomposition and curve ﬁtting (Galford
et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2005). These tools are used together with
remote sensing (Mucherino et al., 2009) and are often combined, e.g. to
use the image processing output as input to a machine learning model
(Vibhute and Bodhe, 2012).
Cloud platforms (together with MapReduce) (Hashem et al., 2015)
oﬀer possibilities for large-scale storing (Nativi et al., 2015), preprocessing, analysis and visualization of data (Becker-Reshef et al.,
2010), while GIS (Lucas and Chhajed, 2004) are used in geospatial
problems (Barrett et al., 2014; RIICE Partnership, 2014). Big datasets
are appropriate for the storing of large volumes of heterogeneous information, using database management systems (DBMS) that implement the array data model and NoSQL database management platform
(Karmas et al., 2016). NoSQL platforms store and manage large unstructured data. Array DBMS are built speciﬁcally for serving big raster
datasets.
Moreover, related to remote sensing applications, vegetation indices
(VI) are frequently used for crops/soils mapping (Sakamoto et al., 2005;
Barrett et al., 2014), deﬁned as combinations of surface reﬂectance at
two or more wavelengths designed to highlight a particular property of
vegetation. The most popular one is the normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), which is a graphical indicator used to analyze remote sensing measurements, and to assess whether the target being
observed contains green vegetation or not (Wardlow et al., 2007;
Thenkabail et al., 2007).
Finally, some online services involve message-oriented middleware,
which serve in event-based systems where fast notiﬁcations and alerts
are necessary, e.g. when some natural hazard is happening (GSMA,
2014; Global Envision, 2006).
4. Discussion
As Section 3 illustrated, a large variety of agricultural issues are
currently approximated by the use of big data analysis, employing a
variety of diﬀerent algorithms, approaches and techniques (see
Table 3). Table 4 presents the speciﬁc, most common software used in
the revised papers, mapped according to the type of analysis employed.
A wide variety of software available for big data analysis exist, in all
diﬀerent types of analysis.
A recent practice is to approximate agricultural problems by employing image analysis (Karmas et al., 2014; Teke et al., 2013), using
images originating from remote sensing (Atzberger, 2013), either from
airborne (Gutiérrez et al., 2008; Barrett et al., 2014; Wardlow et al.,
2007) or satellites (Schnase et al., 2014; Waldhoﬀ et al., 2012;
Sakamoto et al., 2005; RIICE Partnership, 2014; Becker-Reshef et al.,
2010). This is in line with recent statistics showing a tremendous increase in the use of Landsat satellite data after 2008, when the archive

A. Kamilaris et al.

As observed in this study (see Table 1), much of the attention on big
data has focused mainly on large volumes (i.e. applications in weather
and climate change, land identiﬁcation, farmers’ decision-making, insurance and ﬁnance, remote sensing). This has led to a skewed and
narrow perspective of the value of big data to organizations and the
society since aspects of data velocity, variety, veracity and valorization
are equally important, as pointed out by Shin and Choi (2015) and
Capalbo et al. (2016).
Moreover, technical challenges of remote sensing systems for farm
management still exist (Zhang and Kovacs, 2012), such as the collection
and delivery of images in a timely manner (Galford et al., 2008),
sampling errors and the lack of high spatial resolution data (Nativi
et al., 2015), image interpretation and data extraction issues (Karmas
et al., 2014), the inﬂuence of weather conditions (Barrett et al., 2014),
etc. Finally, common barriers involve the absence of data itself (or part
of it) and its limited reliability, variety or time relevance as observed
and discussed in some of the revised papers (Fuchs and Wolﬀ, 2011;
Schnase et al., 2014; Schuster et al., 2011; Armstrong et al., 2007;
Frelat et al., 2016; RIICE Partnership, 2014; Marcot et al., 2001).

the agri-food industry and dependence of the farmers on large corporations about their farming operations becomes possible (Sykuta,
2016). Big data concentrated in the hands of big agri-businesses
limits the potential of this technology, only reinforcing the capacities and business advantages of a few corporations (Carbonell,
2016).
Privacy issues are raised, in respect to who owns the data and who
can monetize it (Nandyala and Kim, 2016). Farmers are concerned
about the potential misuse of information related to their farming
activities (Shin and Choi, 2015), by seed companies or competitor
farms (Carolan, 2016). (Schuster, 2017) warns that hedge funds
might use real-time data at harvest time from a large number of
sources (e.g. weather data, yields predictions, remote sensing, data
from machinery such as combines, etc.) to speculate in commodity
markets.
The practice of big data collection and analytics has raised questions
over its security, accuracy and access, as discussed in (Nandyala and
Kim, 2016) and (Sykuta, 2016).
Moreover, the use of big data diﬀers in developed vs. developing
countries, according to Kshetri (2014) and Rodriguez et al. (2017).
RIICE Partnership (2014) and Syngenta (2010) believe a digital divide exists between developed and developing economies, due to
unbalanced access to technology (i.e. computing power, internet
bandwidth and sophisticated software), and lack of skilled analysts
in the developing world. Especially in respect to volume and variety,
big data in the developing world is smaller-scale and less diverse
(Rodriguez et al., 2017), as the surveyed papers suggest (Tesfaye
et al., 2016; Frelat et al., 2016; Sawant et al., 2016; GSMA, 2014;
Akinboro, 2016). Big data collection eﬀorts mainly beneﬁt big, welleducated farmers who have the means and the expertise to collect it
successfully and accurately (Kshetri, 2014; Oluoch-Kosura, 2010).
From a technical perspective, product developers have only limited
access to ground truth information (Atzberger, 2013), an issue that
has been observed in many of the revised papers (Armstrong et al.,
2007; Waldhoﬀ et al., 2012; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Jóźwiaka et al.,
2016; Frelat et al., 2016). Ground truth information is necessary for
evaluating products and services under various settings and physical
or weather conditions (Capalbo et al., 2016). Also, visualization of
large data volumes is still diﬃcult (Schnase et al., 2014; Karmas
et al., 2016).

4.3. Addressing open problems and overcoming barriers
From a sociopolitical view, many farmers from around the world
started to mobilize and organize themselves (e.g. in cooperatives, online communities), increasing their power in terms of sharing of knowhow and experiences, and big data understanding (Farm Hack, 2010).
Shin and Choi (2015) believe that the data-driven economy has the
potential to create suitable knowledge for the users of data ecosystems,
such as the one of agriculture.
Moreover, formation of a policy framework on data ownership is
required Sykuta (2016)), which will protect owners’ copyrights and
control user access (Shin and Choi, 2015). Policies for data management and security are needed (Kshetri, 2014), towards the democratization of big data, broadening its potential impact and value through
the adoption and accessibility of appropriate support tools (World
Economic Forum, 2012).
From a technical aspect, investments in cloud infrastructures are
essential for large-scale storage, analysis and visualization of agricultural data (Hashem et al., 2015), supporting business analytics in
high scale and speed (Kempenaar et al., 2016). The infrastructures
should be easily accessible by non-technical personnel and not be expensive (Hashem et al., 2015). Techniques such as data aggregation,
data reduction and proper analysis can contribute towards more userfriendly platforms (Karmas et al., 2014). Various ways of technically
managing high volumes of widely varied data, addressing the “V”s dimensions of big data eﬀectively are discussed in Karmas et al. (2016)
and Nativi et al. (2015).
Also, well-deﬁned and commonly accepted technologies for data
semantics (e.g. RDF, OWL, SPARQL and Linked Data) and ontologies
(e.g. AGROVOC, Agricultural Ontology Service and AgOnt) can be used
as common terminologies towards data interoperability, as proposed in
Lokers et al. (2016), Cooper et al. (2013), Kamilaris et al. (2016).
Karmas et al. (2016) suggest that open standards need to be adopted
and agreed for data integration, such as OGC.
Furthermore, open-source software tools and libraries would be
useful, such as crop type maps and calendars (Sakamoto et al., 2005),
biophysical measures and vegetation indices (Wardlow et al., 2007),
yield models (RIICE Partnership, 2014), crop area estimates (BeckerReshef et al., 2010) and seasonal weather forecasts (Tripathi et al.,
2006). These tools should be easily mergeable with other platforms to
support large-scale, highly-varied data analysis, a strategic goal of the
GEOSS platform (Nativi et al., 2015) and MERRA Services (Schnase
et al., 2014).
More big datasets should become publicly available (Carbonell,
2016), and there is a growing trend towards this direction already
(OADA, 2014; GODAN, 2015; AgGateway, 2005). Besides, numerous

4.2. Barriers for wider adoption of big data analysis
Related work indicated various barriers hindering the wider use of
big data analysis, such as lack of human resources and expertise
(Sawant et al., 2016) and limited availability of reliable infrastructures
to collect and analyze big data (Akinboro, 2016; Syngenta Foundation
for Sustainable Agriculture, 2016). Frelat et al. (2016) note that accurate and actionable data requires considerable technical skills to handle
data mining and analysis methods, while infrastructures are needed for
eﬃcient data storage, management and processing of multi-modal and
high-dimensional datasets, including provisioning for real-time processing in many critical geospatial applications (Karmas et al., 2016).
Further, there is generally a lack of structure and governance related
to agricultural big data, as pointed out by Nandyala and Kim (2016)
and Nativi et al. (2015), as well as identiﬁed and addressed in some of
the revised papers (Schnase et al., 2014; Marcot et al., 2001; BeckerReshef et al., 2010). Kempenaar et al. (2016) suggest that business
models are needed that are attractive enough for solution providers,
enabling at the same time a fair share between the diﬀerent stakeholders. In addition, Lokers et al. (2016) consider that the general absence of well-deﬁned semantics complicates big data understanding and
reuse by other researchers and organizations.

(Love et al., 2014; Anon., 2016), would be on the rise within the
framework of the circular economy (e.g. less use of pesticides,
water and nutrient recycling, proximity to the consumer, etc.).
10. Precise genetic engineering, known as “genome editing”, would
make it possible to change a crop or animal’s genome down to the
level of a single genetic “letter” (Hartung and Schiemann, 2014). As
(González-Recio et al., 2015) comment, this could be more acceptable to consumers, because it simply imitates the process of mutation on which crop breeding has always depended, and it does not
imply the generation of transgenic plants or animals. This technology would supplement existing research in epigenetics
(McQueen et al., 1995; Tesfaye et al., 2016).

organizations on the web have started to provide various large-scale
datasets covering a wide spectrum of agricultural areas.2
4.4. Potential areas of application of big data analysis
This subsection lists potential areas of applying big data analysis for
addressing various agriculture-related problems in the future. These
areas have not been covered adequately (or not covered at all) by the
existing research and papers under study (according to the authors’
opinion), and include the following possibilities:
1. Platforms enabling supply chain actors to have access to highquality products and processes (RIICE Partnership, 2014; Sawant
et al., 2016), enabling crops to be integrated to the international
supply chain, according to the global needs (Cropster, 2007;
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, 2016).
2. As farmers are sometimes not able to sell harvests due to oversupply or not getting the planned harvest (Frelat et al., 2016;
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, 2016), tools for
better yield and demand predictions must be developed (Tesfaye
et al., 2016; Kempenaar et al., 2016; Becker-Reshef et al., 2010).
3. Providing advice and guidance to farmers based on their crops'
responsiveness to fertilizers is likely to lead to a more appropriate
management of fertilizer use (Giller et al., 2011). This could apply
as well to better use of herbicides and pesticides (i.e. (Gutiérrez
et al., 2008; Sawant et al., 2016; aWhere Inc., 2015)).
4. Scanning equipment in plants, shipment tracking and retail monitoring of consumers' purchases creates the potential to enhance
products' traceability through the supply chain (Armbruster and
MacDonell, 2014), increasing food safety (Jóźwiaka et al., 2016;
Lucas and Chhajed, 2004). Prevention of foodborne illnesses is an
issue that requires international collaboration and investment by
local/global organizations and governments (Grace and McDermot,
2015), to ensure safer food (Chedad et al., 2001; RIICE Partnership,
2014). Moreover, since the agricultural production is prone to deterioration after harvesting (Wari and Zhu, 2016), optimization
procedures are essential to minimize losses and maximize quality
(Pierna et al., 2004). Promising optimization techniques already
being applied to food processing involve (meta-) heuristics and
genetic algorithms (Wari and Zhu, 2016), as well as neural networking (Erenturk and Erenturk, 2007).
5. Remote sensing for large-scale land/crop mapping will be critical
for monitoring the impacts of various countries and areas in respect
to measuring and achieving their productivity and environmental
sustainability targets (Barrett et al., 2014; Waldhoﬀ et al., 2012;
Schuster et al., 2011; Becker-Reshef et al., 2010).
6. More advanced and complete scientiﬁc models and simulations for
environmental phenomena could provide a basis for establishing
platforms for policy-makers, assisting in decision-making towards
sustainability of physical ecosystems (Schnase et al., 2014; Nativi
et al., 2015; Song et al., 2016).
7. High-throughput screening methods that can oﬀer quantitative
analysis of the interaction between plants and their environment,
with high precision and accuracy (Furbank and Teste, 2011;
Karmas et al., 2014).
8. Self-operating agricultural robots could revolutionize agriculture
and its overall productivity, as they may automatically identify and
remove weeds (Gutiérrez et al., 2008; Blue River Technology,
2011), identify and ﬁght pests (PEAT UG, 2016), harvest crops
(Waldhoﬀ et al., 2012), etc.
9. Fully automatized and data-intensive closed production systems
(i.e. greenhouses and other indoor led-illuminated aeroponics)

2

The majority of the aforementioned potential applications would
produce large amounts of (big) data, which could be used by future
policy-makers to balance oﬀer and demand (applications #1 and #2),
reduce the negative impact of agriculture on the environment (applications #3, #5 and #9), raise food safety (applications #2, #4 and #6)
and security (applications #2, #7, #8 and #10), increase productivity
(applications #8, #9 and #10). The potential open access of this data to
the public could create tremendous opportunities for research and development towards smarter and more sustainable farming.
5. Conclusion
This paper performed a review of big data analysis in agriculture,
mostly from a technical perspective. Thirty-four research papers were
identiﬁed and analyzed, examining the problem they addressed, the
solution proposed, tools/techniques employed as well as data used.
Based on these projects, the reader can be informed about which types
of agricultural applications currently use big data analysis, which
characteristics of big data are being used in these diﬀerent scenarios, as
well as which are the common sources of big data and the general
methods and techniques being employed for big data analysis. Open
problems have been identiﬁed, together with barriers for wider adoption of the big data practice. Various approaches for addressing these
problems and mitigating barriers have been discussed.
As we saw in this survey, the availability and openness of hardware
and software, techniques, tools and methods for big data analysis, as
well as the increasing availability of big data sources and datasets, shall
encourage more initiatives, projects and start-ups in the agricultural
sector, either addressing some of the problems which are now being
addressed by the 34 examples we presented, or focusing on some of the
emerging future application areas we have identiﬁed, or even creating
radical-new services and products applied in new agricultural areas.
This increasing availability of big data and big data analysis techniques, well described through common semantics and ontologies, together with adoption of open standards, have the potential to boost
even more research and development towards smarter farming, addressing the big challenge of producing higher-quality food in a larger
scale and in a more sustainable way, protecting the physical ecosystems
and preserving the natural resources.
