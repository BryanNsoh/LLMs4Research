Many agricultural activities can be highly enhanced by using digital technologies. One of these activities
is the regulation of the quantity of water in cultivated ﬁelds, a process which is directly interwoven with
the sustainability and the productivity of crops, since insufﬁcient or excessive irrigation may not only be
obstructive, but also destructive. This paper proposes a scheme based on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation management with an advanced novel routing protocol for Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSNs), named ECHERP (Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol). At its core,
the proposed system aims at efﬁciently managing water supply in cultivated ﬁelds in an automated way.
The system takes into consideration the historical data and the change on the climate values to calculate
the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation. In case that the change on the collected values is above
a threshold more frequent data collection is proposed to minimize the necessary quantity of water. On
the other hand, in case that the change of the values is below a preset threshold then the time interval
to collect data can increase to save sensor energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime. The results show
that network lifetime using ECHERP is improved up to 1825 min and if a round is 110 s the model provides energy efﬁciency using smaller water quantities.

1. Introduction
Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and, in many cases,
in the survival of nations, since it provides the basic subsistence for
the entire population of a country while at the same time it
interacts with several other industries. Especially in rural areas,
inhabitants depend on agriculture as it is critical not only for their
nutrition but it also constitutes the base of all trade. Moreover, the
ever increasing world population demands larger amounts of
food which subsequently presupposes a well-managed and
cost-effective agriculture.
Throughout the world, irrigation is one of the main water consumers. Almost 60 percent of all the world water, taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wells, is used for the irrigation of.
Without irrigation, crops would never have been grown in the
deserts of California and Israel. Irrigation has been around for as
long as humans have been cultivating plants. Even though the traditional way of pouring water on ﬁelds is still a common irrigation
method, other more efﬁcient and mechanized, methods are also

used. One of the more popular mechanized methods is the centre-pivot irrigation system, which uses moving spray guns or dripping faucet heads on wheeled tubes that pivot around a central
source of water. There are many irrigation techniques farmers
use today, since there is always a need to ﬁnd more efﬁcient ways
to use water for irrigation. Producers need to ﬁnd more effective
and efﬁcient use of water resources while maintaining high crop
yields. Some efforts to more efﬁciently utilize water for crop production are examined, Producers has to ﬁnd more effective and
efﬁcient use of water resources while maintaining high crop yields.
While the producers have to apply water to meet the needs of
the crop, they must realize that with traditional management practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as
compared to a fully irrigated crop. Moreover, to properly manage
the water for the greatest return, producers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how crop rotations can
enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic
practices can inﬂuence the water needs.
Water stress during critical times may result in low yields.
Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every inch of
water that the crop consumes as compared to other crops such
as winter wheat or soybeans. However, crops, such as corn require
more water for development or maintenance before any yield is

S.A. Nikolidakis et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 113 (2015) 154–163

produced. Corn requires approximately 10 in. of water to produce
the ﬁrst increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5 in. for wheat
and soybeans respectively.
The integration of automated procedures in agriculture increases
the productivity as well as the quality of the products, thus fulﬁlling
the ever increasing demand for healthy and inexpensive food
around the world. However, an efﬁcient automated system has to
describe all the main processes that are involved in the agriculture
chain. Plant cultivation, which can be considered as the most critical
process, is affected by many factors such as the temperature, the
humidity and the topography of the surrounding environment.
Achieving ideal values for these factors and optimizing their consequences depend on the type of the crops cultivated. Thus, the design
of an efﬁcient irrigation system should consider these factors to
achieve a successful and high quality harvest. For example, the process of grape maturation is affected by the photo-synthesis that produces the sugar that is stored in the grapes. In grapes, the balance
among sugar, acid, pH and potassium is fundamental in determining
the quality of the produced wine. This balance depends to a large
extent on the frequency of the irrigation of the cultivated ﬁelds.
The scientiﬁc discipline of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
has reached a point of maturity that it can provide accurate and
highly effective services to farmers. Thus, WSNs should monitor
the above described factors to achieve an improved harvest
(Shu-ming et al., 2009). WSNs are able to rapidly capture process
and transmit critical data in real time. The real-time data collected
by sensors located in the cultivated ﬁelds may be used by experts
or by automated systems to make decisions, such as which irrigation policy should be applied. Additionally, since a WSN does not
require the deployment of wires, the need for human intervention
is minimized. For these reasons, it is expected that WSNs will
become a low cost yet effective approach for the monitoring of
ﬁelds in the near future.
Additionally, WSNs can be combined with a system that manages the water applied to each ﬁeld based on the environmental
conditions and on the feedback sent by the individual sensors.
There are several advantages in using WSNs and automated decision systems in agriculture:
 Improved estimation and planning of ﬁeld irrigation based on
the available water supply.
 Minimization of the required human resources, time, and effort
in the agricultural production.
 Early detection of possible ﬂoods in the ﬁeld that could be
destructive for the crops and proper pumping of the water to
mitigate such cases.
 Better coordination between different working groups, i.e.
farmers and technical assistants thanks to a clear division of
responsibilities.
 Creation of knowledge gathered from the deployed sensor networks for future applications in the agriculture domain.
All the irrigation models that have been proposed so far do not
use an agriculture model to calculate the quantity of water for irrigation. Moreover, they use WSNs to collect data from the area
without considering the routing of data from the sensors to the
base station, a technique that could provide improved energy efﬁciency. In this paper, we propose a system that takes into consideration the historical data and the change of the climate values
to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation. In
case that the change of the collected values is above a threshold
more frequent data collection is proposed to be performed to minimize the necessary quantity of water. On the other hand, in case
that the change of the values is below a preset threshold then
the time interval to collect the data can increase to save sensor
energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime.

In this paper an integrated architecture, based on the use of
WSNs, for automated irrigation management is proposed that aims
to achieve effective and prompt irrigation of parcels with great
energy efﬁciency due to the utilization of a novel routing protocol.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work
is presented. Section 3, describes the structure of the proposed system. Section 4, presents the performance evaluation. In Section 5,
the paper is concluded and areas of future work are presented.
2. Related work
The work in the area of WSNs in agriculture is composed of two
parts. The ﬁrst part deals with the routing protocol used to minimize the energy consumption in WSNs, while the second part
addresses the development of irrigation systems in agriculture that
manage the water used for irrigation.
2.1. Energy efﬁcient routing algorithms in WSNs
There exist several proposals to develop protocols that consider
the energy efﬁciency of sensors in their routing activities. In hierarchical networks, nodes are organized in clusters in which a node
plays the role of a cluster head. The cluster head is responsible for
coordinating activities within the cluster and for forwarding information between clusters. Clustering has the potential to reduce
energy consumption and to extend the lifetime of the network,
by achieving a high delivery ratio in a scalable manner. In agriculture, the network used may be rather large since it needs to cover
the entire cultivated ﬁelds. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols
may be suitable and beneﬁcial for precision agriculture.
In (Heinzelman et al., 2000) LEACH, a hierarchical protocol in
which most nodes transmit to cluster heads, is presented. The
operation of LEACH consists of two phases:
 The Setup Phase. In the setup phase, the clusters are organized
and the cluster heads are selected. Each node determines
whether it will become a cluster head in this round by using a
stochastic algorithm at each round. If a node becomes a cluster
head once, it cannot become cluster head again after P rounds,
where P is the desired percentage of cluster heads.
 The Steady State Phase. In the steady state phase, the data is sent
to the base station. The duration of the steady state phase is
longer than the duration of the setup phase in order to minimize overhead.
LEACH is a wireless distributed protocol that helps WSNs to use
less energy. However, LEACH uses single-hop routing where each
node can transmit directly to the cluster-head and the sink. Therefore, it is not recommended for networks that are deployed in large
regions.
PEGASIS is an energy efﬁcient protocol (Lindsey and
Raghavendra, 2002) using a chain-based protocol and providing
an improvement over LEACH. In PEGASIS each node communicates
only with a nearby neighbour in order to send and receive data. It
also takes turns (cluster head transmit after collecting data from all
the nodes) transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the
amount of energy spent per round. The nodes are organized in such
a way as to form a chain, which can either be accomplished by the
sensor nodes themselves, using a greedy algorithm starting from a
certain node, or the Base Station (BS) can compute this chain and
broadcast it to all the sensor nodes.
TEEN is a hierarchical protocol designed for sudden changes in
the sensed attributes, such as sudden drops in temperature due to
frost (Manjeshwar and Agrawal, 2009). Responsiveness is an
important attribute of time-critical applications, in which the

156

S.A. Nikolidakis et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 113 (2015) 154–163

network is operated in a reactive mode. The sensor network architecture in TEEN is based on a hierarchical grouping where closer
nodes form clusters and this process goes to a higher level until
the sink is reached. Even though TEEN works well in conditions like
sudden changes in the sensed attributes, in large area networks
and when the number of layers in the hierarchy is small, TEEN
tends to consume a lot of energy, because of long distance transmissions. Moreover, when the number of layers increases, the
transmissions become shorter and the overhead in the setup phase
as well as in the operation becomes dominant.
In (Lotf et al., 2008), a routing protocol for self-conﬁguration
and hierarchal routing, named ELCH, is presented. In this protocol,
the sensors vote for their neighbours to elect suitable cluster
heads. It combines the cluster architecture with multi-hop routing
for the reduction of the total transmission energy.
The above approaches take into consideration the energy consumption of the sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network. However, since they are general purpose networks they do
not take into account the principles, characteristics and requirements of the speciﬁc application that sensor networks are used for.
All the aforementioned protocols try to minimize the energy
consumption. However, they differ on the algorithm used. Most
of these algorithms are based on the selection of the node having
the higher residual energy in every cluster as the cluster head for
the next round. Although, this consideration seems to be quite
rational, there are many cases where its effectiveness is limited.
For instance, in the cases where the node having the higher energy
residues is positioned close to the border line of its cluster, signiﬁcant amounts of energy are spent by the cluster nodes in order
to transmit to their cluster head.
2.2. Automated irrigation in agriculture
WSNs have been used for the automated irrigation of parcels
(Rehman et al., 2011). These applications address the scarcity of
water problem and the need of proper water management. This
is achieved by providing water only to places where it is needed,
while at the same time controlling the quantity of the consumed
water.
Various models, systems and methodologies for the irrigation of
parcels have been developed. In (Diaz et al., 2011) a methodology
to guide the development of applications for the agricultural
domain based on WSNs is presented. This methodology divides
the development of applications in agriculture in steps that gets
an input, produces an output, and describes the procedures to be
undertaken by a speciﬁc group of users.
Speciﬁcally, the purpose of this methodology is to describe the
life cycle of applications by identifying the responsibilities of the
individual users. In (Stone et al., 1985), a computer-based monitoring system for continuous measurements of soil water potential is
proposed and analyzed. This model measures the quantity of water
during a period. The results are used to decide the quantity of
water to be used for irrigation.
Indirect estimates using direct measurements of the soil moisture are discussed in Zazueta and Smajstrla (1992). In this model
the measurements of time in samples are used to estimate the
quantity of water that is required for irrigation. Moreover, in
Meron et al. (1995) a control system for apple tree irrigation management using densitometers is presented. In this model the water
required for irrigation is measured using a soil sensor-actuated
automatic irrigation system. Sensor actuation thresholds are optimized for high fruit yield and quality.
In (Testezlaf et al., 1997) an automated irrigation control system
for the management of greenhouse container plants is evaluated.
The system consisted of soil moisture sensors, a hardware input/output interface, a computer with the relevant software and actuators.

An evaluation of the control system is performed considering a
greenhouse. The results show that the control system is reliable in
applying water responding to the plant demands. Reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using sensors presented a
major difﬁculty.
In (Kim and Evans, 2009) the design of decision support
software and its integration with an in-ﬁeld WSN to implement
site-speciﬁc sprinkler irrigation control via Bluetooth wireless
communications is described. This model consists of machine conversion, localization, and mission planning. The ﬁrst requirement is
to convert a self-propelled irrigation machine from a conventional
mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically controllable
system for individual sprinkler head control. Then, the geographic
location of the irrigation machine is continuously monitored by a
self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable and
accessible, mission planning decide the time to irrigate that each
sprinkler head should apply at each location.
In (Sudha et al., 2011), a TDMA-based medium access control
(MAC) protocol is used to collect environmental data such as soil
moisture and temperature of an irrigation system. The sensors
are in the idle state and change to the active state to measure
the temperature and the moisture level of the soil. The base station
sends requests to nodes to collect the temperature and the moisture level of a particular area. A node responds to this request by
sending back the present value of the moisture and the temperature of that region. The other nodes remain in the idle state.
After sending the required data the node goes back to the idle state.
This process is repeated for all the nodes. In using a direct communication method each sensor node sends its data directly to the
base station.
In addition to the above, there also exist some recent attempts to
develop remote sensing and control systems for irrigation management using WSNs. In (Kim et al., 2008), a remote sensing and control of an irrigation system using a distributed WSN is described.
The ﬁeld conditions are monitored by sensor stations distributed
across the ﬁeld based on a soil property map, and they are periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. In
(Xiaohong et al., 2009), a water-saving irrigation system based on
fuzzy control technology and WSN is described. The node takes
the soil moisture error and error change rate as its input and obtains
the water demand amount of the crops under certain soil moisture
conditions. In (Dubey et al.., 2011), a WSN based remote irrigation
control system and automation using dual tone multi frequency
(DTMF) code is described. The system uses signalling to control
the water ﬂow for sectored, sprinkler or drip section irrigation. In
(Zhang et al., 2011), a calibration method for detecting soil water
content based on information sharing is described. The system is
an efﬁcacious approach to determine the balance between the
calibration accuracy of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. All these attempts propose systems that are
able to provide irrigation services to parcels without considering
in depth the efﬁcient management of the water used.
3. Overview of the proposed system
The proposed system considers climate values, such as humidity,
temperature and wind to calculate the quantity of water that is
needed for proper irrigation. Also, when evaluating the climate
parameters it considers past states and compares them to the current states to make efﬁcient decisions. For example, if the value of
the temperature in the previous day has decreased then less water
is required. Based on the collected historical values the quantity
required might be larger. Thus, water can be conserved in case of
a high rate of change of these environmental values. The total complexity of the model is 2n + n, where n is the number of nodes in the
cluster.

The proposed automated irrigation management system, as
mentioned above, aims at the automatic irrigation of parcels with
possibly non-uniform composition like the one shown in Fig. 1,
which comprises of ﬁve neighbouring parcels having different
crops.
The proposed automated irrigation management system comprises of two subsystems. The ﬁrst subsystem concerns the WSN
which collects the data from the cultivated ﬁelds, as shown in
Fig. 2a. The second subsystem involves the decision making system, the ﬂow chart of which is depicted in Fig. 2b.
The proposed WSN structure includes a set of sensors that
monitor the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity,
the temperature and the speed of air, and the duration of sunshine
hours per day. The individual sensors are placed at appropriate
locations in the parcels. The collected information is transmitted
to a base station.
More speciﬁcally, the sensors at the ﬁeld scan the weather conditions periodically (for example every 10 s). The collected data are
sent via wireless (for example, a ZigBee radio transmitter) to the
base computer at the receiver. The sensors are self-powered by a
battery. A set of sensors is used to measure air humidity and temperature. Also humidity sensors are used to measure soil moisture
content and wind speed. Moreover, specialized sensors are used to
measure the ﬂooding water levels.
The main application is based on the collected inputs it receives
from the sensors. It then, acts based on the conﬁguration that is
applied to the system. This conﬁguration is based on the requirements for the place that needs to be monitored. This is related to
the type of crops that are planted in the ﬁeld (corn, potatoes,
etc.), the chemical soil components (i.e. sodium content) and the
season of the year (i.e. winter, summer etc).
This system can be used by growers, who want to monitor the
status of soil moisture content and watch on their computer monitor the conditions at various locations, follow the weather information and monitor in detail the irrigation operation. During the
irrigation, they may also want to see the current location of irrigation. For example, if a rain shower passes over the ﬁeld, the software should be able to automatically adjust the amount of water
being applied.
In the proposed system, the routing protocol that is used to
send trafﬁc from the information sources to the destination
assumes the coexistence of a base station and, without loss of
generality, of a set of homogeneous sensor nodes. These nodes

are randomly distributed within a delimited area of interest. The
base station is located at a long distance away from the sensor
ﬁeld. Both the base station and the set of sensor nodes are considered stationary. The base station is able to transmit with high
enough power to all the network nodes, due to its unlimited power
supply. Moreover, the sensors are hierarchically organized into
clusters.

3.1. The irrigation and decision making system

Fig. 1. Neighbouring parcels hosting different kinds of crops.

In agriculture, the efﬁcient management of water should be considered. Therefore, the water required for irrigation has to be minimized. The proposed system based on the information sent from the
sensors estimate the quantity of water needed. The sensors are used
to send to the base station the humidity and the temperature of the

158

S.A. Nikolidakis et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 113 (2015) 154–163

soil, the humidity, the temperature and the speed of the air, and the
duration of sunshine per day. The proposed system based on these
values calculates the water quantity for irrigation. Moreover, to
develop a more accurate system the historical data regarding the
quantity of irrigation used in previous period are considered to
adjust the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation. A comparison between current and past states is necessary to arrive at optimum decisions.
The main parameters that affect the surface runoff are the following: the climate (rainfall intensity, moisture content, wind,
evaporation) and the type of vegetation.
An important factor for the implementation of an irrigation system is the knowledge of the soil moisture at the beginning of the
growing season, which depends mainly on the weather conditions
during the preceding winter. Additionally, the knowledge of the
water quantity stored in underground aquifers, which is available
for plants through the capillary rise, is critical.
In order to reach a decision for the irrigation needs of a particular parcel, it is necessary to add up the useful water from the
rain (Pe), the change in the stored moisture (SM) in the soil root
zone at the beginning of the germination period, the crop
evapotranspiration (ETc) and the water that by capillary elevation
reaches the crop rooting zone from the ground (GW) – all these are
measured in kg/m2 day. If the soil is cohesive, the water can easily
rise above the ground level, but the rate of capillary rise is slow. On
the contrary, if the soil is light, then the height of the capillary rise
is limited, but the pace of growth is fast. If these rates are sufﬁcient
to meet the water needs of the plant there is a steady development
of the crop and the following holds:

ETc  ðPe þ SM þ GWÞ ¼ 0

ð1Þ

If these water sources cannot meet the water needs of the crops
for normal growth, the water balance is in deﬁcit. To achieve a
smooth development and a normal yield, the crops should be provided with a quantity of water (IRn) equal to this deﬁcit:

IRn ¼ ETc  ðPe þ SM þ GWÞ kg=m2 day

ð2Þ

where ETc is expressed as follows:

ETc ¼ ETokc kg=m2 day

ð3Þ

kc is the crop coefﬁcient and ETo is the reference evapotranspiration
in kg/m2 day that is expressed as follows:

ETo ¼ 0:0023RaðTmean þ 17:8ÞTD0:5 kg=m2 day

ð4Þ

where Ra is the theoretical solar radiation expressed as equivalent
depth of evaporated water in mm d1, Tmean is the mean air temperature in °C and TD is the difference between maximum and
minimum air temperature in °C.
Pe is presented as follows:

Pe ¼ f ðDÞð1:25Pt 0:824  2:93Þ100:000955ETc kg=m2 day

ð5Þ

where Pt is the total precipitation in kg/m2 day and D is the decline
allowed in the soil moisture content until the next irrigation dose is
applied. The function f(D) is an adaptation factor that equals 1 when
D = 75 kg/m2 day, whilst for every other value of D f(D) is expressed
as follows:

f ðDÞ ¼ 0:53 þ 0:0116D  8:94E  05D2 þ 2:32E  07D3

ð6Þ

The SM contribution is signiﬁcant in a water balance model for
net crop requirements. The soil moisture is controlled by a combination of climate properties, land surface model characteristics and
land–atmosphere interaction.
GW contributes to the partial coverage of net the crop water
requirements, through capillary elevation. The extent of the

capillary elevation depends on the soil characteristics and the distance to the water table.
In this paper, the main focus is on the use of a WSN to collect
data using sensors and to send the data to a database. Then the
sensed data can be used by a system for the automated irrigation
of the ﬁelds. Therefore, in this paper Pe, SM, GW are not further
analyzed. It is assumed that their values are provided by appropriate tensiometer sensors.
Therefore, Pe, SM, GW are considered to sum up to a value k as
presented in the following:

Pe þ SM þ GW ¼ k kg=m2 day

ð7Þ

In this framework we consider k to be equal to the total amount
of rain in this area expressed in kg/m2 day.
Nevertheless, the value of the evapotranspiration (ETc) that is
used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration
from the land surface to the atmosphere is calculated based on
information provided by sensors located in the ﬁelds. Evaporation
is related to the amount of water that is sent to the air from sources
such as soil, canopy interception and waterbodies. Transpiration is
the amount of water in a plant and the subsequent loss of water as
vapor through the stomata in its leaves.
The rate of evapotranspiration depends on climatic factors (i.e.
on temperature, sunlight, wind speed, and humidity). Therefore,
an increase in the temperature in the wind speed or in the amount
of sunlight results to a corresponding increase of evapotranspiration. On the other hand, humidity has the opposite effect.
The models used in the literature to estimate the water quantity
are categorized in empirical, computational and combinational.
The empirical relationships are based on air temperature
(Hargreaves, 1974; Thornthwaite and Hare, 1965). They only
require as input the value of the air temperature and calculate
the water without using other parameters, such as moisture or
wind speed. Moreover, they are based on the mean values of temperature and may provide limited results if the period of use is less
than a month.
The computational models are based on the solar radiation
(Caprio, 1974; Idso et al., 1977). They use the value of the radiation
during the day to estimate the water without considering other
parameters as moisture or temperature. They may have limited
performance if the parcels are on a hill. The computational models
may provide more accurate results as they consider all the environmental parameters to estimate the water for irrigation.
In (Monteith, 1965), a combination model for the water based
on parameters as temperature, moisture and wind speed is proposed. This model is general and does not consider the kind of
crops in the estimation process of the required water. In
(Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), a model that is an improvement of
the model in Monteith (1965) and it is based on the kind of crops
is proposed. However, both models offer high complexity and are
difﬁcult to use in case of frequent changes on the parameters.
Therefore, in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) a model that is based on
the previously proposed models but is more ﬂexible due to its

low complexity is proposed. This model does not use the resistance
of the surface to estimate the water.

these values are based on the soil and air humidity values reported
by the sensors.
The parcels are categorized based on the geographical, topological and climate information as well as on the type of crops cultivated in them. In Fig. 1, we see an example where ﬁve different
parcels with different crops are monitored. The parcels are then
divided into clusters and the sensors are allocated in each cluster.
For example, parcel A can be divided into two clusters. Then, based
on the above mentioned characteristics of each cluster and on the
real time data collected by the sensors the quantity of the water

Therefore, the quantity of water needed for irrigation
(QWrequired) is calculated as follows:

It is important to consider the mean values of the humidity and
the temperature of soil, the humidity, the temperature and the
speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day for the
speciﬁc geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, their
mean values for a speciﬁc area during the same month in previous
years could provide indication on the environmental conditions.
These mean values combined with the real time values collected
by the sensors could provide better results for the water quantity
required for irrigation.
The proposed model is considered as an improvement to the
one proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) as it estimates the water
for irrigation based on the previous values collected by sensors. An
example that proves the efﬁcient management of water by the system is the case that for a speciﬁc ﬁeld the mean water required for
irrigation based on (14) is 10 kg/m2 per day. This quantity of water
can be minimized if historical data are considered. If historical data
are used, then the mean value for irrigation could be less than the
current measurements. If the value is 5 kg/m2 the water that will
be used for irrigation will be less than the current amount (using
(14)) and it can be calculated as follows:
QW required ¼ ðQW history  QW i Þ=QW history ¼ ð5  10Þ=5 ¼ 1 kg=m2 day

Therefore, there is no need for irrigation when historical data
are used but there is a need to pump out water. Thus, water can
be managed more efﬁciently. Moreover, in case that the mean ratio
of change of the water required for irrigation the previous month is
1 and the current water required for irrigation is 10 kg/m2 then
less water is required for irrigation (see Tables 1 and 2).
In Fig. 3 the water quantity required for a cluster in relation to
the quantity of water history and the water based on the sensor
data is shown.
In Fig. 4 the water quantity required for a cluster as a function of

aggregates the data and then transmits the compressed data to
the upper lever cluster heads until the data reaches the base
station.
The sensor nodes placed in a WSN have the responsibility of the
event detection, data processing and transmission of data. The
energy spent on these actions has to be minimized as the nodes
are battery equipped and thus have limited energy. The notation
of rounds is used to describe the successful send of data from sensors to the BS. Therefore, one round is the one-time data send from
all sensors to the BS.
The energy ETx(k,d) that a node dissipates for the radio transmission of a message of k bits over a distance d is due to running both
the transmitter circuitry ETx-elec(k) and the transmitter ampliﬁer
ETx-amp(k,d) and is given by the following:

in Table 4.

ETx ðk; dÞ ¼ ET X-elec ðkÞ þ ETx-amp ðk; dÞ ¼ Eelec  k þ eamp  k  d

where Eelec is the transmitter circuitry dissipation per bit, which is
supposed to be equal to the corresponding receiver circuitry dissipation per bit and eamp is the transmit ampliﬁer dissipation per
bit per square meter. Moreover, in case that the node distance from
the base station is d, it is more efﬁcient to split this distance including a few nodes in the middle. In case that d = d1 + d2 + d3, then

d > d1 þ d2 þ d3 . Thus the ETx(k,d) reaches its minimum value.
Similarly, the energy ERx(k) dissipated by a node for the reception of a k bit message is due to running the receiver circuitry
ERx-elec(k) and is given by:

ERx ðkÞ ¼ ERX-elec ðkÞ ¼ Eelec  k

In this section, the proposed model is evaluated using ECHERP, a
protocol that pursues energy conservation (Nikolidakis et al., 2013).
ECHERP is a scheme that is based on the appropriate selection of
nodes as cluster heads. It models the network and the energy spent
to transmit data from sensors to base station, as a linear system.
Then, using the Gaussian elimination algorithm it selects the cluster
heads of the network. Its main characteristic is that it elects as
cluster head the node that minimizes the total energy consumption
on the cluster.
Based on the energy level and location information that the
nodes send, each node sets up a neighbour information table and
sends this table along with its corresponding information to its
neighbours. This information is sent to the BS that runs a Gaussian
elimination algorithm to compute the number of rounds at which
every node can be a cluster head, trying to maximize the network
lifetime. The BS broadcasts the unique IDs of the newly selected
cluster heads and their cluster members and the nodes use this
information to enter a cluster. The lower level cluster head

In order to evaluate the performance of ECHERP, simulations
over 50 different 100 m  100 m network topologies were performed. The general network architecture considered is the
following:

Average Energy Disippation (Joule)

4. Performance evaluation of the proposed model

ð22Þ

 A ﬁxed base station is located away from the sensor nodes.
 The sensor nodes are energy constrained with a uniform initial
energy allocation.
 Each node senses the environment at a ﬁxed rate and always
has data to send to the base station.
 The sensor nodes are immobile.
 The network is homogeneous and all nodes are equivalent, i.e.
they have the same computing and communication capacity.
 The network is location unaware, i.e. the physical location of the
nodes is not known in advance.
 The transmitter can adjust its ampliﬁer power based on the
transmission distance.
In all the simulation scenarios we examined 100 homogeneous
nodes with an initial energy of 3 J, randomly scattered within a
100  100 m2 sensor ﬁeld. The BS was positioned at point
(0,150), so it is at least 100 m away from the centre of the ﬁeld
and the packets sent are 36 bytes. The energy consumption due
to communication is calculated using the ﬁrst order energy model
(Heinzelman et al., 2000). We assume that each sensor node generates one data packet per round to be transmitted to the BS. The

sensor nodes were grouped into clusters consisting of cluster heads
that send data to upper level cluster heads to ﬁnally reach the BS.
Fig. 7 shows the number of nodes that remain alive when
LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP are applied. More precisely, the depletion of all the network nodes in LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP takes
place during the 800th, 980th and 995th rounds respectively.
Fig. 8 shows the average energy dissipation of the compared
protocols as a function of time measured in rounds. As this ﬁgure
depicts, the performance of ECHERP is considerably better than
LEACH and ELCH.
A more analytical description of the effects of the use of the
three protocols in comparison may be derived by focusing on
the ﬁrst node depletion time, the last node depletion time and
the average energy consumption. Table 5, summarizes the simulation results which are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, concerning these
metrics in the case of uniform energy distribution.

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a
number of simulations using different values of time required for
a round have been considered. In the simulation tests the
trade-off between the time of a round and the water required is
deﬁned. The main objective of this model is to keep the energy
consumption of the nodes in low level while having more accurate
measurements from sensors on the water required.
The total water required for irrigation is expressed as follows:

Total Water ¼ Mean Water  rounds

ð23Þ

where Total Water represents the quantity of water required based
on the irrigation model presented in (17). Mean Water represents
the average value of the water required when different values of
time for a round are considered. Moreover, the round represents
the number of times that the exchange of data from sensors to base
station is performed.
The quantity of water required for irrigation is calculated as
follows:

Water ¼ Total Water=lifetime

ð24Þ

S.A. Nikolidakis et al. / Computers and Electronics in Agriculture 113 (2015) 154–163

Based on the above formulas simulation tests were performed
to calculate the quantity of water required and the lifetime of
the network for various values of round time ranging from 10 to
230 s. In all the tests it was assumed that the duration of the network lifetime was equal to 995 rounds. The simulation results are
summarized in Table 6.
Therefore if a round in ECHERP is equal to 110 s energy efﬁciency is provided while smaller quantities of water are consumed.
5. Conclusions
This paper focused on the issue of automated irrigation in agriculture and proposed a novel system for efﬁcient irrigation using
WSNs. The proposed system is based on a model which performs
efﬁcient irrigation management by ﬁnding the appropriate
schemes for the rational utilization of water for irrigation. The
automated irrigation system proposed is based on the use of a novel routing protocol named ECHERP. The utilization of this protocol
offers remarkable energy efﬁciency. The development of novel systems, like the one proposed in this paper, which combines efﬁcient
irrigation models along with energy efﬁcient utilization of WSNs
shows to be a very promising and effective application of automation in agriculture. The proposed model can be further extended to
consider the effect of the ﬁeld characteristics on the quantity of
water required for irrigation.
